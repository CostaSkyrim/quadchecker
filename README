A brief user guide.

Create files. 
To use quadchecker program, first we need to create quadA, quadB, quadC, quadD, quadE and quadchecker binaries. Here is the example code to create these files :- $ go run main.go build quadA

Usage. 
The files can be run the following ways 
$ ./quadA 3 3 | go run .
$ ./quadA 3 3 | ./quadchecker
$./quadC 1 1

Thats all. Have fun playing with it.
